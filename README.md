# ‚ÑπÔ∏è About:
Fluent Localization Scripts is a set of utilities designed to simplify the translation experience when manually editing Fluent files.

I'm using it to keep Russian translation synchronized with the English one in the Floorp Browser.

# Requirements:
 - Nodejs
 
# üõ†Ô∏è Installation:
```
git clone https://github.com/regularenthropy/fluent-localization-toolkit
```

# Usage:
1. Download the original localization file and place it in the same directory as the scripts.
2. Create a new Fluent file with your localization and place it in the same folder.
3. Edit the necessary values in the source code.
4. Run the script (it will print results in a console)
5. Edit the "exception_keys.txt" file if you want to add exceptions for the script.
